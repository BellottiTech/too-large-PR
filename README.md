# too-large-PR
The following application was developed as a exercise in maintaining small PRs for our course on [Effective Code Reviews](https://www.bellotti.tech/effective-code-reviews).

## About the course
[Bellotti.tech's](https://bellotti.tech) course of code reviews covers both how to organize and polish your code to get through code review smoothly and how (and why) you should be giving code reviews at all levels of experience. It's part of a [series of courses](https://www.bellotti.tech/coder-bootcamp-post-grad) intended to help engineers who have just graduated self-study or coder bootcamp programs plan their paths to senior software engineer roles.

## Coder Bootcamp Post Grad
[Coder Bootcamp Post Grad](https://www.bellotti.tech/coder-bootcamp-post-grad) is a course series intended for new software engineers overwhelmed by all the things they need to gain mastery of to feel settled in a new career in the engineering space. Topics include career planning, how to manage impostor syndrome, refactoring tricks and training yourself on edge cases.

## Exercise Instructions
Clone this repo on you own machine

`git clone https://github.com/BellottiTech/too-large-PR.git`

Make sure to fetch the branch `too-large-pr`

Using git rebase, reorganize the commits so that we have can add the same functionality in a series of small PRs, rather than a massive PR. You can use any technique discussed in the course to structure things how you like.
